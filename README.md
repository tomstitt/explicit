# explicit

Make those playlists explicit if we can.

Find all tracks w/o explicit=true and do a search.

Fuzzy compare with all tracks found that are explicit and if close enough (fuzzy compare > tolerance) add to list.

Replace if user is all good with it.

Thanks to fuzzyset.js, handlebars.js, spin.js, fancybox.js, and jquery.js for doing the hard work.

And spotify for their stylesheets.
